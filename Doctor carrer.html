    <strong><h2>About Doctor</h2></strong>
    <h3>There is no other profession in the world that gets as much respect as a doctor. A doctor treats and interacts with patients on a daily basis. A career as a doctor provides one an opportunity to cure patients, thus bringing happiness into the lives of the people. To enter into this profession, one must have patience, compassion, concentration, emotional strength, quick thinking and an eye for detail. The job of a doctor is to diagnose and treat illness and injury. Doctors examine patients and arrive upon diagnosis, perform surgeries, prescribe medications, educate patients and their family members, check patientsâ€™ records and keep an eye on their recovery.

     Doctors often counsel patients on their diet, hygiene and lifestyle changes that can improve their overall well-being. They may set up their own practices or work for medical corporations, such as in government and private hospitals. They fulfill their duties by relying on the services of other health professionals, such as nurses and diagnostic technicians, and administrative staff.</h3>
